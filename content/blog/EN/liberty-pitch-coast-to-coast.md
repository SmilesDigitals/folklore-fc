## From Sea to Shining Sea

America is a land of massive scale and diversity. From the foggy cliffs of San Francisco to the busy harbors of New York City, it is a nation defined by its horizons.

**Liberty Pitch - Coast to Coast** is an ambitious attempt to capture this grandeur on a single piece of fabric. It is a unifying jersey, one that brings together the East and the West, the North and the South, onto the neutral ground of the soccer pitch.

### The Great American Collage

This design is a visual journey across the continent:

*   **The Golden Gate**: On the right flank, the iconic Art Deco towers of the Golden Gate Bridge rise from the fog in unmistakable "International Orange."
*   **Lady Liberty**: On the left flank, the Statue of Liberty raises her torch, lighting the way for the attack. Her robe folds merge into the fabric of the shirt.
*   **The Heartland**: Connecting them across the chest is a stylized skyline that includes the Gateway Arch of St. Louis and the rolling plains of the Midwest, grounding the design in the center of the country.
*   **Central Compass**: A soccer ball sits at the heart of the design, styled like a compass rose, indicating that wherever you play—North, South, East, or West—football is the home direction.

## The Traveler's Kit

Soccer is the most global sport, but in the US, it is also the most local. Every city has its club, its pub, its supporters group.

This jersey is for the fan who travels. The away-day warrior who drives 6 hours to watch their team play in a different state. It is a badge of honor for those who have seen the diversity of American soccer culture firsthand.

> "I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list."

Whether you're playing pickup in Central Park or Venice Beach, this shirt fits the vibe. It celebrates the unique flavor of American geography.

## Unifying Comfort

To unite a country, you need to be comfortable.

We used our **Continental-Blend** fabric for this release. It's a medium-weight textile that offers substantial coverage (good for cooler Northern states) but remains breathable enough for the Southern humidity. It's the "Goldilocks" of soccer fabrics—just right.

The print quality is museum-grade. The details of the landmarks—the cables on the bridge, the spikes on the crown—are crisp and clear, making this a wearable piece of art.
