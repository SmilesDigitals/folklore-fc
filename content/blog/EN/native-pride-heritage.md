## Deep Roots, Soaring Spirit

There is a profound connection between sport and spirit in indigenous cultures. Games have always been a way to honor the creator, to test one's limits, and to bring communities together.

**Native Pride - Heritage Bicycle Kick** is a celebration of this enduring legacy. It captures the intersection where ancient tradition meets the modern acrobatic beauty of soccer. It is a visual representation of a spirit that cannot be kept on the ground—it must fly.

### Art in Motion

This jersey is one of the most artistic pieces in the Folklore FC collection. We collaborated with designers inspired by indigenous art styles to ensure authenticity and beauty.

*   **The Aerial Warrior**: The central graphic depicts an indigenous athlete performing a spectacular bicycle kick. Trailing from his motion are eagle feathers and spirit lines, suggesting that he is being lifted by the wind itself.
*   **Turquoise and Silver**: The color palette draws from traditional jewelry and the colors of the Southwest sky and earth. The deep turquoise body is accented with silver and terracotta piping.
*   **Geometric Borders**: The hem and collar feature patterns inspired by Navajo weaving—symbols of protection, mountains, and the four cardinal directions.

## A Story of Resilience

The bicycle kick is an act of pure defiance. It turns the player upside down; it risks a hard fall for the chance of glory. It is the perfect metaphor for the indigenous experience—resilience, adaptation, and the ability to rise above challenges in spectacular fashion.

This jersey is for the player who carries their heritage with them onto the pitch. It is for the fan who understands that soccer in America didn't start in 1994 or 1970, but shares the land with cultures that have been here for millennia.

> "We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children."

In the same way, we borrow the game for 90 minutes. We must play it with respect, beauty, and honor.

## Crafted for the Elements

The connection to nature extends to the fabric itself.

*   **Eco-Aware Production**: We use recycled polyester fibers in the construction of this jersey, reducing our footprint on the earth.
*   **Breathable Weave**: The "Spirit-Mesh" fabric is ultra-lightweight, mimicking the feeling of running with the wind. It creates a cooling microclimate against the skin.
*   **Seamless Comfort**: To prevent irritation during movement, the jersey features seamless side construction.
