## The Rhythm of the Game

From the block parties of the Bronx to the stadiums of the world, Hip Hop and Soccer share a common DNA: rhythm, flair, creativity. and self-expression. They are both universal languages, spoken on street corners and in packed arenas. **Street Sound FC - Boombox Lioness** is the ultimate remix of these two cultures, dropping the beat on the beautiful game.

This kit is for the player who moves to her own beat. The one with the footwork that looks like a dance, the dribbling that has a flow, and the strike that hits like a bass drop. It's for the player who brings swagger to the pitch.

### Urban Royalty

We wanted a design that felt loud, proud, and royal—something that commanded respect in the concrete jungle.

*   **The Queen**: The central figure is a Lioness wearing a golden crown, sitting atop a vintage boombox. She represents strength, leadership, and ownership of the streets. The lioness is the primary hunter, the protector, and the power of the pride—a perfect symbol for the female baller.
*   **Speaker Ball**: The speakers of the boombox are stylized as soccer balls, pumping the sound of the game. It visualizes the idea that football is the music of the streets.
*   **Graffiti Background**: A subtle, layered graffiti tag pattern in the background gives the jersey depth and texture, like a city wall telling a thousand stories. It adds grit to the design.
*   **Turquoise & Purple**: A vibrant, retro-future colorway that pops against the concrete grey base. These colors were staples of early 90s streetwear, bringing a nostalgic yet fresh vibe.

## Built to Move

Breakdancing requires flexibility. So does playing the number 10 role. We engineered this kit for maximum mobility and durability, ensuring you can perform your best moves without restriction.

### Flex-Tech
*   **4-Way Stretch**: The fabric moves with you in every direction. Whether you're doing a bicycle kick, a slide tackle, or a victory dance, the shirt moves with your body, not against it.
*   **Breathable Side Panels**: Mesh inserts in "Cyber Purple" run down the ribs, ensuring airflow keeps you cool when the tempo rises. Ventilation is key when you're bringing the heat.
*   **Durable Print**: The colors are fused into the fabric at high heat (sublimation), ensuring that the vibrant turquoise and purple never fade, crack, or peel, even after 100 washes.
*   **Reinforced Neck**: The crew neck is reinforced with elastane to maintain its shape, resisting stretching even if it gets pulled during a scramble in the box.
