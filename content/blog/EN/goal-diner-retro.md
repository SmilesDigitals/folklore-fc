## Order Up!

Welcome to **Goal Diner**, where the service is fast, the vibes are retro, and we're serving top-corner screamers and delicious assists all day long. This jersey is pure American nostalgia, celebrating the golden era of neon signs, roller skates, jukeboxes, and milkshakes.

It's for the player who brings the fun to the team. The one who celebrates with a dance. The one who keeps spirits high in the locker room. The one who knows that soccer is a game, and games are meant to be enjoyed. Why so serious? Put on your skates (cleats) and have a blast.

### A Delicious Design

We cooked up something truly special in the design kitchen, mixing 50s pop culture with football culture to create a dish that everyone will love.

*   **Checkerboard Floor**: The side panels feature the classic black-and-white checkerboard pattern found on the floor of every authentic diner. It adds a dynamic, racing-style element to the sides of the kit.
*   **Neon Typography**: The sponsor logo and front text are styled like a flickering neon tube sign, glowing against the fabric. It brings the electric atmosphere of a Friday night hangout to the pitch.
*   **The Waitress**: The crest features a roller-skating waitress, but instead of a tray of burgers, she's balancing a spinning soccer ball. It represents balance, speed, and service (providing assists to your teammates!).
*   **Mint Shake Green**: The primary color is a soft, pastel "Mint Green," reminiscent of a vintage Cadillac or a pistachio milkshake. It is fresh, cool, and aesthetically pleasing.
*   **Menu Details**: Even the size tag inside the neck is designed to look like a guest check, adding a hidden layer of detail for the wearer.

## Comfort Food for the Body

It looks like a fun costume, but make no mistake: it performs like elite pro gear. We believe you can look cute and play like a beast at the same time.

### The Special Sauce (Technology)
*   **Soft-Serve Fabric**: Our proprietary material is incredibly soft to the touch, preventing chafing during long games. It feels like your favorite worn-in t-shirt but has the properties of a tech garment.
*   **Spill-Proof**: The fabric is treated with a stain-release technology. Grass stains (or ketchup stains from the post-game meal) wash out significantly easier than with standard cotton.
*   **Retro Collar**: The neckline features a cute, rounded "Peter Pan" style collar built into the performance fabric. It adds to the waitress aesthetic but lies flat and doesn't irritate the neck.
*   **Cool-Down Tech**: The fabric is highly breathable, ensuring you stay cool even when the match heats up.

> "Life is like a diner. You can get anything you want, as long as you are willing to pay the price (in effort). So order the big victory."

## For the Team Spirit

This is the ultimate jersey for building team morale. It's impossible to be in a bad mood while wearing it. It brings a smile to the face of fans, teammates, and even the referee. It says, "We're here to win, but we're going to look good doing it."
