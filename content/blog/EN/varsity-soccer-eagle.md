## Campus Legend

There's nothing quite like the energy of collegiate sports. The rivalries that bridge generations, the pride of wearing the school colors, the marching bands, and the timeless tradition. **Varsity Soccer USA - Eagle Power** captures that classic American university aesthetic and brings it to the global game, creating a look that is both nostalgic and fiercely competitive.

This jersey is for the player who studies the game as much as she plays it. The one with high football IQ, the tactical discipline, and the execution to match. It represents the "Scholar Athlete"—intelligent, dedicated, and skilled.

### The Letterman Look

We deconstructed the classic letterman jacket—the ultimate symbol of athletic achievement in American schools—and rebuilt it as a high-performance soccer kit.

*   **The Crest**: The chest features a large, chenille-texture print of a Bald Eagle wearing a soccer jersey. It's bold, aggressive, and undeniably American. The eagle isn't just a bird; it’s a symbol of focus and dominance from above.
*   **Block Typography**: The "USA" lettering is rendered in a traditional collegiate slab-serif font, outlined in white for maximum visibility. It looks like it was stitched onto a wool sweater in 1955.
*   **Sleeve Stripes**: Double stripes on the sleeves mimic the cuffs of a varsity jacket, adding a retro athletic touch that frames the arms perfectly.
*   **Navy & Gold**: A timeless color combination that signifies excellence, tradition, and victory. The "Midnight Navy" base is authoritative, while the "Old Gold" accents suggest championship quality.

## Honor Roll Performance

It has the vintage look of heavy wool and cotton, but the technology is cutting-edge. We've ensured that this jersey performs at a varsity level.

### Smart Fabric
*   **Study-Hall Comfortable**: The fabric is soft enough to wear to class (or work), but durable enough for match day. It uses a soft-brush finish that feels gentle on the skin but resists pilling.
*   **Cool-Zone Mesh**: Strategically placed mesh panels under the arms ensure you stay cool even during overtime. It regulates your temperature when the pressure is on.
*   **Fade-Resistant**: The navy blue is engineered to hold its deep color, wash after wash. It won't turn into a purple-grey shade after a season of use.
*   **Structure**: The collar and cuffs are knit with elastane to hold their shape, giving the jersey a crisp, tailored, and professional appearance at all times.

    <summary className="font-bold text-lg text-slate-900">Q1: Is the eagle patch real chenille (fuzzy)?</summary>
    <p className="mt-2 !text-black leading-relaxed">A1: No, it is a high-definition 3D print that *looks* like chenille texturally but is smooth and breathable performance fabric. Real chenille would be too heavy and hot for soccer.</p>

    <summary className="font-bold text-lg text-slate-900">Q2: Is the fit unisex?</summary>
    <p className="mt-2 !text-black leading-relaxed">A2: This is a women's specific cut, meaning it is slightly more fitted in the waist. Men wanting this look should size up 2 sizes due to the tapering.</p>
