## Ignite the Pitch

Some players play nice. Some players play safe. And then there are the players who set the field on fire.

**Ghost Rider USA - Spirit of Vengeance** is a high-octane tribute to American motorcycle culture and the rebellious spirit that refuses to follow the rules. It’s loud, it’s aggressive, and it’s undeniably cool.

### Hell on Wheels

We wanted a design that felt like a custom chopper paint job brought to life:

*   **The Flaming Skull**: Dominating the chest is a skeleton rider, skull engulfed in flames, leaning into a turn.
*   **Soccer Ball Wheels**: Look closely—the motorcycle wheels are spinning soccer balls, wreathed in fire.
*   **Hellfire Gradients**: The jersey fades from a deep asphalt black at the bottom to a searing orange and yellow at the top, mimicking a rising inferno.

## For the Maverick

This kit is for the winger with blistering pace. The striker with the explosive shot. The player who plays with a chip on their shoulder and an engine that never quits.

It intimidates. It distracts. It tells the opposition that you’re not here to make friends—you’re here to burn past them and score.

> "I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride."

Channel that outlaw energy. Be the player they talk about in fear after the game.

## Built for Speed

Despite the heavy metal look, this jersey is aerodynamically designed for speed.

The **Turbo-Dry** fabric wicks sweat instantly, keeping you light even when your body temperature redlines. The fiery graphics are sublimation printed, meaning they won’t weigh you down or block airflow like a plastic heat-press would.
