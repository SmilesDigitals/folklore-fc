## Thunder from the Midfield

There is nothing in football quite like the sound of a perfectly struck long-range shot. The thud of the boot, the silence as the ball cuts through the air, and the explosion of noise when it hits the net.

**Heavy Artillery - Long Range Cannon** is dedicated to the masters of the "Golazo." It is for the players with gunpowder in their boots. Inspired by historic American field artillery—from the Civil War to the modern era—this jersey symbolizes overwhelming firepower and distance.

### The Big Gun Aesthetic

We aimed for a design that feels weighty, historic, and powerful.

*   **The Cannon Graphic**: The jersey features a highly detailed illustration of a vintage 19th-century field cannon, smoke billowing from the barrel. Instead of a cannonball, it is firing a speeding soccer ball.
*   **Gunmetal Grey**: The primary color is a deep, metallic gunmetal grey (Iron Ore), giving the shirt a sleek, industrial look that pairs perfectly with black shorts.
*   **Foundry Typography**: The numbering and lettering on the shirt use a stencil font reminiscent of military crates and ammunition boxes.
*   **Smoke Accents**: Subtle gradients of white and light grey drift across the torso, mimicking the lingering smoke of the battlefield.

## For the Game Changer

This jersey is not for the timid. It takes courage to shoot from 30 yards out. It takes an ego. It takes the belief that you can change the game with a single swing of your leg.

Heavy Artillery is the uniform of the confident midfielder and the ambitious striker. It sends a message to the goalkeeper: "You better stay on your line."

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." — Wayne Gretzky (and Michael Scott)

This is the most American philosophy in sports. Shoot your shot. Go for glory. The Heavy Artillery kit is the physical embodiment of that mindset.

## Ballistics and Performance

A heavy theme doesn't mean a heavy shirt. In fact, this is one of our most technologically advanced garments.

*   **Aerodynamic Fit**: We removed excess fabric to ensure that wind resistance is minimized. You pass through the air just like your shots.
*   **Recoil absorption**: Okay, it doesn't actually stop recoil, but the reinforced collar and shoulder seams are built to withstand the physical tug-of-war of corner kicks and celebrations.
*   **Smokeless Breathability**: The fabric features micro-pores that release heat instantly, keeping your core temperature stable even after multiple high-intensity sprints.
