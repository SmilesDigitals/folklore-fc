## No Pyro, No Party

Football is nothing without passion. It's the smoke in the air, the chants in the stands, the raw energy that shakes the stadium.

**Wanted for Pyro - Outlaw Spirit** connects the lawless days of the Wild West with the modern "Ultra" culture. It’s a jersey for the fan who lives for the atmosphere, the noise, and the spectacle.

### The Most Wanted

This design is a masterclass in gritty storytelling:

*   **The Wanted Poster**: The main graphic mimics an old-school Wild West "Wanted Dead or Alive" poster, but instead of a bank robber, it features a masked supporter holding a flare.
*   **Smoke Effects**: Wisps of red and orange smoke curl around the bottom hem, creating a 3D atmosphere effect.
*   **Distressed Paper Texture**: The entire shirt has a beige, parchment-like background that looks like it's been nailed to a saloon wall for weeks.

## Stand Your Ground

The "Outlaw" isn't a criminal; they are a believer. They are the 12th man who refuses to sit down. They are the heartbeat of the club.

This jersey is perfect for the supporter section. It says you're here to make noise. It says you’re loyal to the bone. It captures the rebellious, tribal nature of true football fandom.

> "Win or lose, we are here."

Wear it to the tailgate. Wear it in the march to the match. Wear it when you storm the pitch (figuratively, please).

## Fan-Friendly Comfort

While it looks rough and ready, it feels incredible.

Designed for long days in the sun and crowded stands, the **Air-Flow** fabric ensures you stay cool even when the atmosphere heats up. It’s loose enough to wear over a hoodie in the winter, making it a year-round staple for the die-hard fan.
