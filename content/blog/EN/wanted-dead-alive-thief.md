## High Noon Kickoff

In the old West, legends were pasted on saloon walls and telegraph poles. Today, they are made on highlight reels and viral clips. **Wanted: Dead or Alive - The Game Thief** connects the notoriety of the historic outlaw with the lethality of the modern striker.

This jersey is for the player who steals goals, steals possession, and steals the show. She is the one the opposition manager warns their team about in the locker room. "Don't let her turn! Don't let her get space!" She is dangerous, elusive, and always gets the reward.

### Parchment & Ink

The design is a masterpiece of texture and typography, breaking the mold of traditional sleek sports gear.

*   **The Paper Effect**: The entire jersey mimics the look of aged, sun-baked parchment paper. It's uneven, stained with "coffee" and time, and looks like it survived a dusty trail ride. This texture is fully sublimated, so the shirt stays soft despite looking rough.
*   **The Portrait**: The center features a woodcut-style illustration of a female outlaw, bandana over her face, eyes locked on the goal. It evokes the mystery and menace of a bandit whose face is known only by the trail of defeat she leaves behind.
*   **Typography**: Huge wooden-block letters spell out "WANTED" across the chest, demanding attention. It uses authentic western fonts that look hand-pressed.
*   **Bullet Holes**: Stylized (printed) bullet holes scatter the design, adding to the dangerous aesthetic and implying a player who has survived the battle.

## Dangerous Performance

You might look like a dusty relic from 1880, but the technology is pure 2024. You'll move like a phantom in the box.

### Stealth Tech
*   **Silent-Weave**: The fabric is engineered to reduce swishing noise as you run, perfect for sneaking up on the back post unnoticed.
*   **Dust-Repel**: The fabric coating prevents dirt from embedding deep in the fibers, so you can slide tackle without ruining the art. It shakes off the dust just like a rider on the trail.
*   **Cool-Touch**: Despite the warm, sun-baked colors, the fabric reflects heat, keeping you cool under the midday sun.
*   **UV Protection**: The tight weave offers protection against the sun's rays, essential for long days on the plains (or the tournament fields).

## The Legend Grows

Wearing this jersey makes you a marked player. It tells the other team that you are the threat. It takes confidence to wear a "WANTED" poster on your chest. It says, "Come and get me, if you can."

It resonates with the player who plays on the edge, who takes risks, and who isn't afraid to be the villain in the other team's story.
