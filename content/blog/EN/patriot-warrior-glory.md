## United We Sprint

When you put on the colors, you represent something bigger than yourself. You represent a nation of dreamers, doers, and fighters.

**Patriot Warrior - Running to Glory** is the ultimate expression of American soccer pride. It fuses the iconic Stars and Stripes with energetic, warrior-inspired imagery to create a kit that looks like it's moving even when standing still.

### Red, White, & Blue Fury

This isn't a subtle jersey. It's a declaration.

*   **Dynamic Flag Motion**: The American flag is reimagined not as a static rectangle, but as flowing ribbons of red, white, and blue that wrap around the athlete, suggesting speed and wind.
*   **The Sprinter**: A central graphic depicts a warrior in full stride, breaking through barriers. It represents the relentless forward momentum of the US game.
*   **Star-Spangled Shoulders**: A field of stars covers the upper chest and shoulders, honoring the 50 states and the stars of the pitch.
