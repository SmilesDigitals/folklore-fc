## Chop Down the Competition

Victory isn't given; it's hewn from the rough. It takes sweat, grit, and hours of chopping away at obstacles until they fall.

**Timber! - The Hard Work Tee** is for the engine room of the team. The box-to-box midfielders, the tireless wingbacks, the players who cover every blade of grass. Inspired by the legendary American lumberjack, it's a badge of honor for the blue-collar baller.

### Plaid Power

We've taken the iconic visuals of the Pacific Northwest and the North Woods:

*   **Red & Black Buffalo Plaid**: The most recognizable pattern in American workwear forms the base of this jersey, instantly conveying ruggedness.
*   **The Are & The Ball**: A central crest featuring crossed axes and a soccer ball carved from wood (complete with wood chips flying).
*   **Sawtooth Trim**: Sleeves and hem feature a sawtooth pattern, adding a sharp, aggressive edge to the design.

## Embrace the Struggle

When your lungs are burning in the 85th minute, this jersey reminds you to keep going.

The legend of Paul Bunyan wasn't built on ease; it was built on power and scale. "Timber!" is about imposing your physical will on the game. Winning the 50/50 balls. Making the recovery run. Being the hardest worker in the room.

> "Don't pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one."

Wear this, and opponents will know: they're in for a long, hard day.

## Functional Ruggedness

Despite the flannel appearance, this is high-tech gear.

We utilize a "brushed" polyester finish that feels soft against the skin but wicks moisture incredibly fast. It's tough enough for slide tackles on Sunday league turf but stylish enough for a Portland brewery tour.
